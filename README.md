# Network-Hardening-Analysis
<h1>Description</h1>
In this exercise, I am presented with a scenario involving a social media organization that has recently suffered a significant data breach due to undetected vulnerabilities. My task was to address this breach by identifying common network hardening tools that can be applied to enhance the organization's overall security. Subsequently, I pinpointed a specific vulnerability within the company and proposed various network hardening techniques to mitigate it. Lastly, I elucidated how the chosen methods and tools will effectively manage the vulnerability and proactively prevent future breaches.

Based on my knowledge about network hardening and security-related practices, such as port filtering, network access controls, and encryption protocols for safeguarding network communications. These network hardening practices empower organizations to proactively monitor potential threats and thwart certain attacks from compromising their networks. Some of these measures are implemented as routine safeguards, while others are periodically enacted, such as bi-weekly or monthly reviews. Proficiency in utilizing network hardening tools and methodologies have equipped me with the capability to vigilantly monitor network activities and fortify an organization's network against a spectrum of potential threats.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Review the scenario below.

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.


- <a> After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows: </a>
    -  The organization’s employees' share passwords.
    -  The admin password for the database is set to the default.
    -  The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
    -  Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 


If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.
