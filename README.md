# Network-Hardening-Analysis
<h1>Description</h1>
In this exercise, I assumed the role of a cybersecurity analyst employed by a company hosting the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. The website's visitors encountered a security issue while loading the main webpage, and my responsibility was to conduct a thorough investigation, identify the problem, document your findings, and propose a solution to rectify the security issue.

During my investigation of this security event, I examined a tcpdump log to uncover the network protocols employed in establishing connections between users and the website. These network protocols serve as the rules and standards governing data transmission among networked devices. Unfortunately, malicious actors can exploit these very protocols to infiltrate and attack private networks. Acquiring the skill to identify commonly used attack protocols is crucial for safeguarding your organization's network against such security incidents.

In successfully completing this assignment, I compiled a detailed account of the events surrounding the security incident and provided a recommendation for implementing a security measure to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Review the scenario below.

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 


- <a> After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows: </a>
    -  The organization’s employees' share passwords.
    -  The admin password for the database is set to the default.
    -  The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
    -  Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 


If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.
